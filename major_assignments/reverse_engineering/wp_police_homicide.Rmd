## Statement 1 (trying to answer it) 
## As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted. (A killing each day for three straight years = 1,095 killings)

```{r}

    str_detect(city, "Baltimore")
         ) |>
